Have you ever wanted to slack off at work and mindlessly scroll through Reddit or some other mind numbing entertainment platform, but were too afraid your boss would catch you in the act?

Join me in creating a little helper in disguising our dissociative escapades â€“ namely creating an extension that would allow the toggling between the classic Reddit interface and that of Microsoft Outlook.  

By the way, it just so happened I picked these two as the central figures, but I think this should help in creating similar pairings, as I have covered pretty much all the important aspects of such a task.
